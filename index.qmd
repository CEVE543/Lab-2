## Topics

- DataFrames.jl for data manipulation
- Plotting with CairoMakie.jl
- TX precipitation datasets
- Basic exploratory data analysis
- AI-assisted coding with GitHub Copilot

## AI-Assisted Coding Introduction

This lab introduces practical use of AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot for plotting and data manipulation tasks.
Focus areas include getting syntax help for CairoMakie.jl plotting commands and DataFrame operations where syntax can be complex and hard to remember.

**Best Practices:**

- Use AI assistance for syntax and documentation lookup rather than conceptual understanding
- Verify AI-generated code makes sense before running it
- Particularly useful for CairoMakie plotting syntax which has many options and parameters
- AI excels at translating "I want a scatter plot with these axes" into correct syntax

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't use AI to write entire analysis workflows without understanding the steps
- Always understand the data manipulation logic even if AI helps with syntax
- Plotting concepts (choosing appropriate visualizations) should be your decisions, not AI's
